### Introduction
This Project was A milestone Project focused on building a Data centric Webpage for Code institute.
This was to be achieved using technologies such as the flask framework for simplfing development
And Mongdb for storing information in a database. I decided that a simple web app for adding, editing, deleting recipes would
Best help me to achieve this.

## UX
The website was built with a mobile first approach. The client wanted a website that was easy to use and simple to navigate
### User Stories

**As a** New Visitor  
**I want** the website to be easy to navigate   
**So that** Itâ€™s easy to find Latest Recipes 

**As a** New Visitor   
**I want**  to see all recipes available
**So that**  I have a good variety to view

**As a** Returning Visitor  
**I want** to be able to add new recipes   
**So that** I can share my recipes with the world 

### Strategy
 + This project is for the creation of a website for Secret Recipes to help people share recipes and also  that is visually pleasing and has an ease of use.

### Scope
+ The website should be responsive, work on all devices and browsers. The website must consist of , recipes, be able to add,edit and delete recipes.
### Structure
+ The overall structure of the website is that of a branching structure.

#### Database Schema
+ The Database chosen for this project was the NOSQL database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) . The Data base consists of two
Collections shown below. A recipes collection and a course type collection. I added the second course type collection because in a future 
Iteration of this project i want to be able to implemnt a search by course type function.

+ An example of Recipe collection consisting of an _id(object) and the users inputed info('string).

### Surface

+ A Mostly black and white colour theme was used for this website, which showcases the classic professional look. Cards were used on the home page fro the recipe becuae it makes the page look very clean and simplistic.


# FEATURES
### Existing Features
+ **Navbar** - A Navbar is available which links to  all sections of the webpage
  * On Mobile these links are hidden in a sidenav for better functionality.
+ **Add Recipe Button** - The add recipe button is featured on the home page on Mobile and tablet to take the user directly to the form to add recipes.
+ **Materialize cards** - Materialize cards were used to house the recipes title and imamges on the home and all recipes pages.
+ **Form** - A form was used to make for the user to be able to add,edit and delete data to the database.

### Features Left to Implement

+ **Search function** - In a future iteration i want to implement an option that the user can search by course type and indvidual recipes.
+ **Login** -  The ability for the user to login and only they may edit or delete there own recipes.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
+ **HTML** - This is the Markup Language used to create the main structure of the website.
+ **CSS** - I used CSS to style the visual look of the webpage.
+ **jQuery** -[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) used to help Materializecss Intialization
+ **Javascript** - used in sidenavbar

### Backend
+ **MongoDB** - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) was the database used
+ **FLask** - [Flask] Flask is the micro web framework i used thats written in Python.
+ **Jinja2** - [Jinja2] The templating language used for python
+ **python** - used to loop through recipes


### Other technologies used
+ **Gitpod** - [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the only IDE I used throughout development.
+ **Git** -  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control.
+ **GitHub** - [Github](https://github.com/) was used to host the repository for this project.
+ **Heroku** - [Heorku] (www.heroku.com) was used for deployment of the webapp.




## Testing
+ During development I used CRUD to make sure the database was fully functional before proceding with any further design process.
+ I then, worked through my user stories to make sure my website reached all the requirements of my user stories, before moving on to the more technical testing.
+ I ran the HTML for all pages through [W3C HTML Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) by direct input. - **Working as intended**
+ All links tested manually - **Working as intended**
+ All buttons tested manually - **Working as intended**
+ Tested different screen sizes using Google Developer Tools.
  * Pixel 2 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 6 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 7 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone 8 - **Working as intended**
  * iPhone X - **Working as intended**
  * iPad - **Working as intended**
  * iPad Pro  - **Working as intended**
  * Laptop with HiDPI screen **Working as intended**

+ I got friends to test out the live site on Heroku and give me Feedback on any issues. 
+ I used my Huwawei P20 smart Android Phone to test website - **Working as intended**
+ The website was tested on different browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.

### Issues fixed 
+ On the update recipe form. The Iamge was not updating to the database. This was fixed by adding one line to the update_recipe route. 
'image': request.form.get('image'),

## Deployment

### How to Deploy our project to Heroku ###

+ First we need create a requiremnets.txt file in our IDE
+ We do this by typing in the command terminal pip freeze > requirements.txt
+ Next we need to create a procfile
+ We do this by typing into the command terminal echo web: python.py > procfile
+ Next we need to git add . , git commit -m ' ' and finally git push or requiremnets file and proc file to our Github repository.
+ Login to www.heroku.com
+ Create new app
+ Name your app and choose your region
+ Click create app
+ In your command termianl IN OUR IDE you need to type heroku login
+ Enter requested Username and Password
+ In command terminal type heroku git:remote Secret-Recipes 
+ In command terminal git add . , git commit -m ' '
+ In command terminal git push heroku master
+ Return to heroku.com
+ Click on Settings
+ Click on reveal Config Vars
+ Set IP to 0.0.0.0
+ Set Port  TO 5000
+ Add your MONGO_URI and Sexret key to link to your database
+ Now click Open app to deploy your webapp
